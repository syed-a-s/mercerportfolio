# The Collatz Conjecture

All programming languages have an iterative version and a recursive version
The iterative version is named "collatz.___" and the recursive version is called "collatzR.___"

Fortran - compile by typing "gfortran" and then the file name. Run the program by typing "./a.out"
Go - compile and run by typing "go run" and then the file name
Julia - compile and run by typing "julia" and then the file name

All of them will ask you to enter a number greater than 10. And they will output the top 10 sequences in from 10 to your desired range.
If you enter less than 10, it will just return the info from 1 to 10

LISP

Lisp has been added. Instead of asking you to enter the range, you will need to put the desired range in command line

First, compile and run the program by typing "chmod u+x help.lisp" and then "./help.lisp range", where range is the integer you
want to see the calculations for.
