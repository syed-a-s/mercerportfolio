          Software Development Method for Project 3
          
    (a) The program needs to convert a date entered from the user into a corrected date format with the day of the week
    
    (b) Input : The date entered in the format month day, year. The entered date cannot be case sensitive
        Output : The program will give the correct date along with the day of the week for that date
  
    (c)                            Algorithm for ConvertDate Proj
    
                  1.      input : entered as a string this format --> month day, year
                          output : give out date in this format --> dayOfWeek, month day, year
                          
                  2.      Conversion of the Date Entered
                          
                          J = century (ex: 19 in 1998)                        
                          Use string class to find the first two numbers  
                          
                          K = year within century (ex: 98 in 1998)        
                          Use string class to find the first two numbers
                          
                          m = month 
                          Use string class to find where the month is located in the date collected
                          
                          date2 = day of the month 
                          Use string class to find where the day is located in the date collected
                          
                          After finding those values, use this equation to find the day of the week :
                          h = (date2 + 26(m + 1)/10 + K + K/4 + J/4 + 5J) % 7
                          h will equal from 0 to 6 or Saturdat to Friday respectively
                          
                          Print out the converted date (dayOfWeek, month day, year)
