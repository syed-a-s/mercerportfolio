        Caesar's Cipher
        
  a) The program will take a passwor from the user and takes its ASCII value and the that 
  to the original ASCII values of a test file. It will also do the opposite and decrypt the
  text file.
  b) Input: 1. The file the user wants to encrypt/decrypt
            2. The file the user wants to create and store the encrypted/decrypted message into
  c) The Algorithm
  
        The Program needs to repeat if the user wants to. To do that, use a while loop
        
        The main method will call other methods to complete the task.
        Main method          
        {
        
        }
        
    *** intro()
        
        Simple print messages to make the the greeting look nice
        
        getPassword()
        
    *** Prompt user for a password to encrypt/decrypt with
        
        Use a for loop to count the length of password
        Add all values and return it
        
    *** getFileName(String prompt)
    
        Simply scan for the file name
    
    *** getType()
    
        Use a do loop with a boolean value. The value will change depending if they Encrypt/Decrypt 
        or if the user puts an invalid input
        
        The boolean value will be the opposite of what it needs if the input is invalid causing
        the loop to restart
    
    *** rerunPrompt()
    
        Checks if the chars are the same. Then it will decide if it should loop or not
