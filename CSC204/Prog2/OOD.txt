		Software Development Method for Proj 2

a.) A clerk needs to calculate the amount of change for a purchase to give to the customer. The clerk also needs to indicate how many
    hundreds, fifties, twenties, tens, fives and ones are needed to best return the change. 

b.) There will be two inputs: the total amount due and the money recieved from the customer. Then it will output the best types 
    of dollar bills needed to reach the difference between the two inputs.

c.)                   Algorithm for Change Project

    1.) input amount due as double 
        input amount tendered as double 
        
    2.) Calculate the change due in dollars
    
                Change due = Amount Tendered - Amount Due 
          ex.
                Change Due = 100 - 21 = $79
                
          Do not accept the amount tendered if it is less than the amount due. Then prompt to ask again for more $.
                
    3.) Convert Change Due Into 100s, 50s, 20s, 10s, 5s, 1s 
    
                      79 / 100 = 0 <---- # 100s
                      79 % 100 = 79 <---- change left
                      change left / 50 = 1 <---- # 50s
                      change left % 50 = 29 <---- change left
                      29 / 20 = 1 <---- # 20s
                      29 % 20 = 9 <---- 9 <---- change left
                      9 / 10 = 0 <---- # 10s
                      9 % 10 = 9 <---- change left
                      9 / 5 = 1 <---- # 5s
                      9 % 5 = 4 <---- # 1s
    
    4.) Print out results
