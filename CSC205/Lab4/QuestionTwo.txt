         Lab 4 Questions 
         
         
         2. a) The capacity is the total number of cells while the size is 
               the number of cells that actually have data in them.
                
            b) It can hold as many as it can before it runs out of memory.
               However, theoretically, it can hold up to 2,147,483,647 elements.
                
            c) 1. Arrays are fixed length and the length cannot be changed after created.
               2. Memory is already allocated to Arrays, so it can lead to wasted memory if
                  every spot in an array is not used. 
                  
               Arraylists do not have these issues.
               
            d) 1. If you need to work with fixed values, then arrays are better for that.
               2. Arrays do not cause slowdowns as much as ArrayList so it can be better
                  for speed.
